Lawrence Gilman Roberts (December 21, 1937 â€“ December 26, 2018) was an American engineer who received the Draper Prize in 2001 "for the development of the Internet",[4] and the Principe de Asturias Award in 2002.

As a program manager and later office director at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Roberts and his team created the ARPANET using packet switching techniques invented by British computer scientist Donald Davies and American Paul Baran.[5][6][7] The ARPANET, which was built by the Massachusetts-based company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), was a predecessor to the modern Internet. He asked Leonard Kleinrock to apply mathematical models to simulate the performance of the network. Roberts later served as CEO of the commercial packet-switching network Telenet.
